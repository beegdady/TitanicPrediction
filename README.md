# TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION.

The Titanic survival prediction  project is a Machine Learning project based on the Titanic ship accident which occured April, 1912 and the aim of this project is to create machine learming models to predict the chances of survival of individuals on the voyage.


## WHAT IS INCLUDED ?
1. A dataset folder - which includes a csv file contaning 891 instances(observation) of individuals.

2. A jupyter notebook .ipynb file which contains all the processes (Exploratory data Analysis, data cleaning and modelling) carried out on the data.

3. Going forward, I would create a simple web app which would give a demonstration of the project.
